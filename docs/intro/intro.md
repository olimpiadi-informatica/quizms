# What is QuizMS?

QuizMS is a JavaScript framework designed to create and manage competitions based on a series of questions. QuizMS is designed to be flexible: it can support different types of questions (single-choice, multiple-choice, open-ended, block programming...), can be used for online competitions, can generate PDF tests for paper-based exams, and can also be used for continuous online self-training. Can be linked to a Firebase backend or to a self-hosed backend in rust. It supports anti-cheating measures, including randomization, question variants, teacher passcodes, session uniqueness checks. Finally, it provides support for localisation into different languages.

It has been used in the School Selections of the Italian Olympiad in Informatics and in the Fibonacci Games since 2023, and in 2025 it has been endorsed by the call for projects of the International Olympiad in Informatics.
